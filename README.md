# cs110_finalProject_minesweeper
This final project was to implement a console based version of minesweeper. This was actually my favorite final project of Fall 2020 and I really enjoyed implementing each feature.

One of the extra features I added for extra credit was the difficulty selection, altering the size of the board and number of mines the user must contend with. 

The Minesweeper.java and Driver.java are wholly my own code, while the others are my code, but based on a UML provided for the project.
